# WordPress

You can integrate Rybbit into your WordPress site to track user behavior and gather analytics. There are several ways to do this depending on whether you're using a hosted WordPress.com site or a self-hosted WordPress.org installation.

## Option 1: Use a Plugin

If you don't want to modify your theme files directly, you can use a plugin to inject the Rybbit snippet. This is the only option for WordPress.com users.

1. Install the [Insert Headers and Footers](https://wordpress.com/plugins/insert-headers-and-footers) plugin.
2. Go to the plugin settings and paste your snippet into the `<header>` section.
3. Save your changes.

## Option 2: Add to `functions.php`

If you're using a self-hosted WordPress theme, you can add the script via `functions.php`.

1. In your WordPress dashboard, go to **Tools > Theme File Editor**.
2. Open the `functions.php` file.
3. Add the following code:

```php
function add_rybbit() {
  ?>
  <script
    src="https://app.rybbit.io/api/script.js"
    data-site-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"
    async
  ></script>
  <?php
}
add_action("wp_head", "add_rybbit");
```

4. Save the file.

## Option 3: Modify `header.php`

You can also manually add the script to your theme's HTML header if using an older version of WordPress.

1. Go to **Appearance > Theme Editor**.
2. Open the `header.php` file.
3. Paste your snippet right before the closing `</head>` tag.
4. Save the file.
