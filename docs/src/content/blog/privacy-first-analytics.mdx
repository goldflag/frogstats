# Privacy-First Analytics with FrogStats

In today's digital landscape, respecting user privacy isn't just good ethics—it's good business. FrogStats was built from the ground up with privacy as a core principle.

## Cookieless Tracking

FrogStats offers full functionality without requiring cookies:

- Uses privacy-friendly server-side techniques
- No persistent identifiers stored on user devices
- Complies with cookie consent requirements

## GDPR Compliance

Our platform is designed to help you maintain GDPR compliance:

- Data processing agreements available
- Data minimization principles applied
- Easy user data export and deletion

## Data Anonymization

We automatically anonymize sensitive information:

```js
// Instead of collecting full IP addresses
// 192.168.1.123 → 192.168.1.0
```

## Respect for User Preferences

FrogStats automatically respects Do Not Track (DNT) settings:

```js
window.frogStats = {
  websiteId: 'YOUR_WEBSITE_ID',
  respectDNT: true  // Enabled by default!
};
```

## Self-Hosting Option

For maximum control, you can self-host FrogStats on your own infrastructure:

- Full data ownership
- Data never leaves your servers
- Complete transparency

Choose FrogStats for analytics that respect your users while delivering the insights you need.
