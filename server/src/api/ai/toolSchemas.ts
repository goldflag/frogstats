- browser: Helps in analyzing which browsers are most commonly used.
- operating_system: Displays trends based on the OS, which can influence design decisions.
- device_type: Critical for optimizing user experience across different devices.
- dimensions: The display resolution of the user's device. Useful for optimizing visual layout and responsiveness.
- language: Useful for internationalization and understanding the linguistic demographics.
- country: Provides insights into geographic distribution and regional traffic patterns.
- region: A specific country subdivision, such as a state or province. Useful for granular geographic analysis beyond just the country level.
- referrer: The URL of the webpage that referred the user to the site. Helps in tracking traffic sources.
- pathname: The path component of a URL that the user visited. Useful for analyzing which specific sections or pages of the site are most popular.
- entry_page: Identifies the entry point for sessions, which is valuable for understanding the initial touchpoint of the user experience.
- exit_page: Provides insight into where users leave the site, which can help in analyzing drop-off points and improving retention.`;

The allowable values for each parameter are described below.

- browser:
    - Description: A string extracted from the User-Agent header representing the browser name.
    - Examples: "Chrome", "Safari", "Edge", "Firefox".
- operating_system:
    - Description: A string representing the operating system from the User-Agent header.
    - Examples: "Windows", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "iOS".
- device_type:
    - Description: A string that indicates the type of device accessing the site.
    - Allowed Values: "Desktop", "Mobile", or "Tablet".
    - Notes: This is a closed set, so only these three values are acceptable.
- dimensions:
    - Description: A string representing the display resolution in the format "widthxheight".
    - Examples: "1920x1080", "1366x768".
- language:
    - Description: A string conforming to IETF BCP 47 language tags.
    - Examples: "en-US", "en-GB", "fr-FR", or simply "en", "fr" if the region subtag is missing.
    - Notes: The language subtag (e.g., "en", "fr") is always present, while the region subtag (e.g., "US", "GB") may be omitted if necessary.
- country:
    - Description: A string representing an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.
    - Examples: "US", "CA", "GB", "FR".
    - Notes: This standard ensures that only valid two-letter country codes are accepted.
- region:
    - Description: A string representing an ISO 3166-2 code for country subdivisions.
    - Examples: "US-CA" (for California), "FR-IDF" (for ÃŽle-de-France).
    - Notes: This value follows a standardized format with a country code and a subdivision code separated by a hyphen.
- referrer:
    - Description: A string containing the URL returned by JavaScript's document.referrer.
    - Examples: "https://google.com/", "https://reddit.com/".
    - Notes: Since the referrer can be any valid URL, this value can be highly varied; typically, only the domain or full URL is used.
- pathname:
    - Description: A string representing the path portion of a URL, as returned by JavaScript's URL.pathname.
    - Examples: "/home", "/about", "/products/item-123".
    - Notes: This excludes the domain and query string, focusing only on the path structure.
- entry_page:
    - Description: A string representing the path portion of the URL where a session begins, extracted from the first pageview in a session.
    - Examples: "/landing", "/homepage".
    - Notes: It uses the same format as pathname but specifically denotes the entry point of the session.
- exit_page:
    - Description: A string representing the path portion of the URL where a session ends, extracted from the last pageview in a session.
    - Examples: "/checkout", "/thank-you".
    - Notes: Like entry_page, it follows the pathname structure but indicates the session's end page.`);
